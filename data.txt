Streams and buffers

Incoming reqs are streams
streams are ongoing processes and are read in chunks

                                                        |-----------------Buffer-----------------------|
Stream --> Request Body Part 1--->Request Body Part 2--->Request Body Part 3--->Request Body Part 4---> Fully Parsed

This is done so we can work on individual chunk wihtout having to wait for the entire file have to get Parsed
This is how Node handles all requests

We organize incoming request via a buffers
a Buffer is like a bus stop, it is a construct that allows you hold and work on multiple chunks before they
are released you code works with buffers
