MVC pattern

It is all about separation of concerns

Model Views Controller

Models = represent you data in your code, like saving fetching data or in memory.
Views =  represent what the user sees in the App, decoupled from application code.
Controllers = Connecting your model to your Views,contains the in between logic. This also includes Routes.

In an App, which incorporates Express.js the controllers are split across Middleware functions
