Template Engines

Template engines replace placholders or snippets with actual HTML context this is
similar to JSX in React which allows the React Engine to act as the Templating Engine.
This takes the dynamic content into account, this occurs on the server and a dynamic
HTML file is generated on the fly which is then sent back to the users, this all happens
or should happen on the server.
