//Description: Intro to express.js


//--------------------------

What and why
Server Logic is Complex!
Express logic helps with Body Parsing
You want to focus on your business logic, not nitty gritting details
We use a framework for heavy lifting

Alternatives to express.js
Vanilla Node.js


Express.js is all about middleware

Request-->Middleware((req,res,next))=>{...}-->next()--> Middleware((req,res,next))=>{...}-->res.send()-->Response
A request will go through multiple blocks and pieces where you can add multiple third party packages.


//add middleware
//use accepts an array of req handlers

//the function passed in will be applied to every incoming request
//next is a function defined by express.js and has to be executed for the request to travel on to the next middleware
//app use docs syntax app.use([path,]callback[,callback...])
//express goes through the file from top to bottom
//the path or route only indicates what the path has to start with
//if you dont call next the below middle wares will not be reached
//as a best practice if you are sending a response you do not want to call next()
//if you want a middleware to be applied to all req put it on top
